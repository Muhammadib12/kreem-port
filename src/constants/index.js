export const HERO_CONTENT = `My name is Kareem Zeedan, a motivated and ambitious 24-year-old software engineer. I recently completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering. I am fluent in both English and Hebrew, and possess strong communication skills in both languages.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained proficiency in several programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, C, HTML, and React, among others. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set.

I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, which led me to choose AI as the focus of my seminar. During my studies, I worked on numerous projects that deepened my knowledge and hands-on experience in the field. My enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving drives me to seek opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully and grow as a professional.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `In addition to my academic and technical background, I have a diverse range of work experiences that have shaped my character and work ethic. I began working at the age of 18 as a waiter, and later gained hands-on experience in cooling systems and as a delivery personnel in Akko, where I reside. More recently, I have worked as a freelance website developer, creating digital menus for small businesses in need of an online presence.

Outside of work, I am a curious and enthusiastic learner who spends a significant amount of time exploring new topics online and engaging with technology. I also have a deep passion for the sea. As an avid spearfisher, I dedicate at least two days each week to being in the water â€” it brings me peace, clarity, and a sense of relief like nothing else.`;
